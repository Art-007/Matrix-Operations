# Matrix-Operations
## In this Porject we build a class myMatrix with the necessary constructors (and a two dimensional array as the data, where the array can be in int, double, etc., the array can be  2x2, 3x3, 3x5, or in general mxn where m and n may be equal or not). In perfroms operations such as Add, Subtract, Multiply, Determinant, Inverse etc.
